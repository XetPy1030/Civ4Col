Barentsz nutzte die Gelegenheit, und das Gebiet zu kartografieren und meteorologische Beobachtungen zum dortigen Klima zu machen. Im Winter des Jahres 1597 starb Barentsz in Nowaja Semlja, wo er auch begraben liegt.

Cartier to made his first voyage in 1534. His ships traveled to the northern tip of Newfoundland, skirting down its western coast and into the Gulf of St Lawrence. On this voyage Cartier befriended local Indians and heard reports of gold and jewels deep in the interior. He took two Indians back to France along with a supply of maize and descriptions of fertile lands and mineral wealth. Cartier undertook a second voyage in 1535, exploring the St. Lawrence River, sailing upstream to the base of a mountain he named Mont Royal, (Montreal). He traveled back down river and established a winter camp at the site that would eventually be Quebec. A third voyage was undertaken in 1541, with Cartier reestablishing the camp at Quebec while he searched for gold. After a fruitless winter made more harrowing by Indian attacks, Cartier and his advance party left for France in the spring of 1542. Cartier's inability to find gold or to establish any lasting settlements, damaged his reputation, and ended France's interest in the New World for the rest of the century. His achievements in advancing the knowledge and geography of this part of the North American continent, would not be appreciated until the beginning of the 17th century when France again began to explore the Americas.</English>

In der N&#228;he des heutigen Qu&#233;bec liess Cartier &#252;berwintern und dabei das Fort Charlesbourg errichten. Neben seinen Berichten &#252;ber das fruchtbare Land und dessen Reichtum an Mineralien, brachte Cartier bei der R&#252;ckfahrt nach Europa auch zwei Eingeborene sowie Vorr&#228;te an Mais mit. Auf der Suche nach Gold brach er 1535 und 1541 zu weiteren Fahrten auf, blieb aber diesbez&#252;glich erfolglos. Den neu gegr&#252;ndeten Siedlungen machten w&#228;hrenddessen nicht nur die harten Winter zu schaffen, sondern auch die zunehmenden Attacken der Indianer. Nun begann sein Stern alsbald zu sinken und die franz&#246;sische Krone verlor das Interesse an "Neufrankreich". Erst zu Beginn des 17. Jahrhunderts erinnerte man sich bei Hofe wieder der Entdeckungen Cartiers. Unter dem Kommando von Samuel Champlain erfolgte eine neue Welle franz&#246;sischer Entdeckungsfahrten und die dauerhafte Besiedlung der Region.</German>

Bereits als junger franz&#246;sischer Marineoffizier in der Karibik versuchte er mehrmals und zun&#228;chst erfolglos, Kaffeebeeren auf den Westindischen Inseln anzubauen. 1723 gelang es ihm schliesslich, auf abenteuerlichen Wege einen Kaffee-Setzling aus den k&#246;niglichen G&#228;rten von Paris nach Guadeloupe zu bringen. Um an die Pflanze zu kommen, hatte de Clieu wahrscheinlich etliche Beamte und Richter bestochen. Auch der Transport des wertvollen B&#228;umchens erwies sich als lebensgef&#228;hrlich: Erst wurde de Clieu's Schiff von Piraten der Barbaresken-Staaten Nordafrikas angegriffen, dann musste er sich der Holl&#228;nder erwehren, welche um ihr Kaffee-Monopol f&#252;rchteten und Spione zur Zerst&#246;rung der Pflanzen entsandt hatten. Zu guter Letzt wurde sein Schiff in einem Sturm schwer besch&#228;digt - um nicht zu sinken, musste s&#228;mtlicher Ballast &#252;ber Bord geworfen werden. Das letzte Trinkwasser reichte gerade noch aus, um die Pflanzen zu versorgen und letztlich traf de Clieu mit seinem wertvollen Gr&#252;nzeug unbeschadet in Martinique ein. In den folgenden Jahrzehnten entwickelte sich in Franz&#246;sisch-Westindien ein gigantisches Plantagensystem, und de Clieu - inzwischen Gouverneur von Martinique - hatte massgeblichen Anteil daran.</German>

		<English>[H1]Paul Revere[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1735-1818[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Paul Revere was a silversmith and passionate supporter and member of the Sons of Liberty. He took part in the Boston Tea Party and was principal rider for Boston's Committee of Safety, devising a system of lanterns to warn the minutemen of a British invasion. Born to French immigrants, Revere was apprenticed to his father's silversmith business, which he inherited upon his father's death in 1754. In 1757 Revere married Sarah Orne, with whom he had eight children. Not long after her unexpected death in 1773, Revere married again, having an additional eight children with his second wife Rachel Walker. Augmenting his income through engraving and dentistry, Revere by 1760 had become a master goldsmith and was one of Boston's most prominent tradesmen. He joined the Freemasons and befriended other notable activists including James Otis, Dr. Joseph Warren, John Hancock and Samuel Adams. However, it was Revere's ride on April 18, 1775, to warn Boston's neighboring towns of the approaching British army that etched his name into history, commemorated later in the famous poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.</English>

Er nahm an der legend&#228;ren "Boston Tea Party" teil und diente als Kurier im Unabh&#228;ngigkeitskrieg, wobei er mittels Laternen-Signalen eine Art "Fr&#252;hwarnsystem" gegen britische Truppen initiiert haben soll. Revere, Sohn franz&#246;sischer Einwanderer, lernte im v&#228;terlichen Betrieb den Beruf des Silberschmids. Nach dem Tod des Vaters 1754 &#252;bernahm er die Schmiede. Drei Jahre sp&#228;ter heiratete er Sarah Orne, welche ihm acht Kinder schenkte. Kurz nach dem unerwarteten Tod von Sarah 1773, heiratete Revere erneut und zeugte mit seiner zweiten Frau Rachel Walker nochmals acht Kinder. Durch seine T&#228;tigkeiten als Silberschmied, Zahntechniker und Buchdrucker zu Reichtum gekommen, entwickelte sich Revere zu einem einflussreichen Bostoner Gesch&#228;ftsmann. Er wurde Mitglied bei den Freimauerern und der revolution&#228;ren Vereinigung "S&#246;hne der Freiheit", wo er auf Gleichgesinnte wie James Otis, Dr. Joseph Warren, John Hancock and Samuel Adams traf. Ber&#252;hmt wurde sein Kurierritt am 18. April 1775 von Boston nach Lexington und Concorde, um die Bewohner vor den herannahenden Briten zu warnen. Diese Episode wurde von Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in einem ber&#252;hmten Gedicht festgehalten.</German>

		<English>[H1]Jose de San Martin[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1778-1850[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Jose de San Martin was an Argentine general and the prime leader of the southern part of South America's successful struggle for independence from the Spanish Empire. Born in Yapeyu, Corrientes, in modern Argentina, he left his mother country at the early age of seven to study in Malaga, Spain. In 1808, after taking part in the Peninsular War against France, San Martin contacted South American supporters of independence from Spain. In 1812, he set sail for Buenos Aires and offered his services to the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata, present-day Argentina. After the Battle of San Lorenzo and time commanding the Army of the North during 1814, he organized a plan to defeat the Spanish forces that menaced the United Provinces from the north, using an alternative path to the Viceroyalty of Peru. This objective first involved the establishment of a new army, the Army of the Andes, in Cuyo Province, Argentina. From there, he led the Crossing of the Andes to Chile, and triumphed at the Battle of Chacabuco and the Battle of Maipu (1818), thus liberating Chile from royalist rule. Then he sailed to attack the Spanish stronghold of Lima, Peru. On 12 July 1821, after seizing partial control of Lima, San Martin was appointed Protector of Peru, and Peruvian independence was officially declared on 28 July. On 22 July 1822, after a closed-door meeting with fellow libertador Simon Bolivar at Guayaquil, Ecuador, Bolivar took over the task of fully liberating Peru. San Martin unexpectedly left the country and resigned the command of his army, excluding himself from politics and the military, and moved to France in 1824. The details of the 22 July meeting would be a subject of debate by later historians. San Martin is regarded as a national hero of Argentina and Peru, and, together with Bolivar, one of the liberators of Spanish South America. The Order of the Liberator General San Martin (Orden del Libertador General San Martin), created in his honor, is the highest decoration conferred by the Argentine government.</English>

		<German>[H1]Jose de San Martin[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte: [\BOLD]1778-1850[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Jose de San Martin San Martin wurde als Sohn spanischer Eltern in Yapeyu im Vizek&#246;nigreich La Plata im heutigen Argentinien geboren. Er wuchs in Spanien auf und durchlief eine Offizierslaufbahn in der spanischen Armee, der er 20 Jahre lang diente. In dieser Zeit ergriff San Mart&#237;n immer mehr Partei f&#252;r das Unabh&#228;ngigkeitsstreben der spanischen Kolonien in S&#252;damerika. 1812 kehrte er nach Cuyo zur&#252;ck und bildete eine Revolutionsarmee f&#252;r den Unabh&#228;ngigkeitskampf aus. Im Gegensatz zu anderen s&#252;damerikanischen Revolution&#228;ren konzentrierte San Martin sich zun&#228;chst nicht auf Peru, sondern auf die Befreiung Chiles. Zun&#228;chst &#252;bernahm er jedoch das Amt des Gouverneurs im westargentinischen Mendoza, wo er weitgehend ohne Unterst&#252;tzung der Staatsregierung eine Armee aufstellte. Dabei war der chilenische General Bernardo O'Higgins sein wichtigster Vertrauter. 1816 organisierte er die Andenarmee, eine Milit&#228;reinheit, bestehend aus 3500 bis 6000 Soldaten und 1200 Mann Hilfstruppen. Im Jahre 1817 marschierte dieses Regiment auf eine f&#252;r diese Zeit spektakul&#228;re Art &#252;ber die Anden, schlug die Spanier bei Chacabuco in Chile und besetzte die Hauptstadt Santiago de Chile. 1818, nach einem entscheidenden Sieg &#252;ber die Spanier in Maipu, setzte San Martin in Chile eine nationale Regierung ein, jedoch lehnte er das Amt des Pr&#228;sidenten zugunsten Bernardo O'Higgins ab. Im Jahr 1820 f&#252;hrte er eine Operation zur Befreiung Perus aus der spanischen Herrschaft an (siehe: Expedition von San Martin), wozu er seine Armee durch neue chilenische Truppen verst&#228;rken konnte. Er besiegte die Spanier im Dezember 1820 bei Pisco, versicherte sich zun&#228;chst der Unterst&#252;tzung durch eine starke Adelspartei und besetzte erst dann Lima, wo er am 28. Juli 1821 die Unabh&#228;ngigkeit Perus ausrief und zum Protektor des Landes ernannt wurde. Der fortgesetzte Widerstand der Spanier in Peru und Streitigkeiten innerhalb seiner Armee veranlassten ihn, den venezolanischen General und Revolution&#228;r Simon Bolivar um milit&#228;rische Unterst&#252;tzung zu bitten. Die beiden Revolution&#228;re waren sich allerdings in Fragen der Regierungspolitik uneinig. W&#228;hrend San Martin eine Monarchie anstrebte, hielt Bolivar an der Errichtung einer Republik fest. Am 26. und am 27. Juli 1822 versuchten die beiden f&#252;hrenden Personen der Unabh&#228;ngigkeitskriege die Differenzen bei Treffen in Guayaquil letztlich ohne Erfolg zu beseitigen, San Mart&#237;n trat daraufhin zugunsten Bolivars zur&#252;ck. Bis heute ist unklar, ob San Martin aus freiem Willen zur&#252;cktrat, in der Hoffnung, dass dem Weg in die Unabh&#228;ngigkeit durch Bolivar besser gedient w&#228;re, oder ob Bolivar diesen Schritt zur Bedingung f&#252;r seine Hilfe in Peru gemacht hatte. 1824 ging San Martin nach Europa, wo er am 17. August 1850 in Boulogne (Nordfrankreich) starb. 1880 wurden seine sterblichen &#252;berreste nach Argentinien gebracht und in der Kathedrale von Buenos Aires in einem Mausoleum beigesetzt.</German>

		<English>[H1]Blackbeard[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1680-1718[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Edward Teach (also Edward Thatch, c.1680-22 November 1718), better known as Blackbeard, was a notorious English pirate who operated around the West Indies and the eastern coast of the American colonies. Although little is known about his early life, he was probably born in Bristol, England. He may have been a sailor on privateer ships during Queen Anne's War before settling on the Bahamian island of New Providence, a base for Captain Benjamin Hornigold, whose crew Teach joined sometime around 1716. Hornigold placed him in command of a sloop he had captured, and the two engaged in numerous acts of piracy. Their numbers were boosted by the addition to their fleet of two more ships, one of which was commanded by Stede Bonnet, but toward the end of 1717 Hornigold retired from piracy, taking two vessels with him. Teach captured a French merchant vessel, renamed her Queen Anne's Revenge, and equipped her with 40 guns. He became a renowned pirate, his cognomen derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance; he was reported to have tied lit fuses under his hat to frighten his enemies. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]He formed an alliance of pirates and blockaded the port of Charleston, South Carolina. After successfully ransoming its inhabitants, he ran Queen Anne's Revenge aground on a sandbar near Beaufort, North Carolina. He parted company with Bonnet and settled in Bath Town, where he accepted a royal pardon. But he was soon back at sea, where he attracted the attention of Alexander Spotswood, the Governor of Virginia. Spotswood arranged for a party of soldiers and sailors to try to capture the pirate, which they did on 22 November 1718. During a ferocious battle, Teach and several of his crew were killed by a small force of sailors led by Lieutenant Robert Maynard. A shrewd and calculating leader, Teach spurned the use of force, relying instead on his fearsome image to elicit the response he desired from those he robbed. Contrary to the modern-day picture of the traditional tyrannical pirate, he commanded his vessels with the permission of their crews and there is no known account of his ever having harmed or murdered those he held captive. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]He was romanticised after his death and became the inspiration for a number of pirate-themed works of fiction across a range of genres. Little is known about Blackbeard's early life. It is commonly believed that at the time of his death he was between 35 and 40 years old and thus born in about 1680. In contemporary records his name is most often given as Blackbeard, Edward Thatch or Edward Teach; the latter is most often used today. However, several spellings of his surname exist-Thatch, Thach, Thache, Thack, Tack, Thatche and Theach. One early source claims that his surname was Drummond, but the lack of any supporting documentation makes this unlikely. Pirates habitually used fictitious surnames while engaged in the business of piracy, so as not to tarnish the family name, and this makes it unlikely that Teach's real name will ever be known. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]The 17th-century rise of Britain's American colonies and the rapid 18th-century expansion of the Atlantic slave trade had made Bristol an important international sea port, and Teach was most likely raised in what was the second-largest city in England. He could almost certainly read and write; he communicated with merchants and when killed had in his possession a letter addressed to him by the Chief Justice and Secretary of the Province of Carolina, Tobias Knight. The author Robert Lee speculated that Teach may therefore have been born into a respectable, wealthy family. He may have arrived in the Caribbean in the last years of the 17th century, on a merchant vessel (possibly a slave ship). The 18th-century author Charles Johnson claimed that Teach was for some time a sailor operating from Jamaica on privateer ships during Queen Anne's War, and that "he had often distinguished himself for his uncommon boldness and personal courage". At what point during the war Teach joined the fighting is, in keeping with the record of most of his life before he became a pirate, unknown.</English>

		<German>[H1]Blackbeard[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte: [\BOLD]1680-1718[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Unter dem Namen Blackbeard ist einer der bekanntesten englischen Piraten des Nordwestatlantik im Bereich der Amerikanischen Ostk&#252;ste und der Bahamas bekannt. Sein b&#252;rgerlicher Name lautete Edward Thatch und nicht Edward Teach, wie die einzige damalige Tageszeitung der Englischen Kolonien in Nordamerika, die Bostoner News-Letters, f&#228;lschlicherweise wiederholt behauptete. Blackbeard war laut Aussage seines Gefangenen Henry Bostock "ein hochgewachsener schlanker Mann mit einem sehr schwarzen Bart, den er sehr lang wachsen lie&#223;". [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Im Gegensatz zu seinem martialischen Auftreten beim Entern und der offiziellen britischen Propaganda ist kein Fall bekannt, wo tats&#228;chlich Seeleute aufgebrachter Schiffe umgekommen w&#228;ren, sieht man einmal von seinem letzten Gefecht gegen die Royal Navy ab. &#220;ber sein fr&#252;hes Leben ist wenig bekannt. Er wird schriftlich August 1717 zum ersten Mal namentlich erw&#228;hnt. Vermutlich wurde er 1680 in Bristol (England) geboren. Seine Karriere begann er als Matrose auf Schiffen, die w&#228;hrend des spanischen Erbfolgekrieges (1701-1714) von Jamaika aus in See stachen. Die Kapit&#228;ne dieser Schiffe besa&#223;en offizielle Kaperbriefe, die sie dazu berechtigten, im Namen der britischen Krone feindliche Schiffe zu kapern und Beute zu machen. Viele Freibeuter machten nach 1714 jedoch mit ihrem eintr&#228;glichen Gesch&#228;ft weiter, ohne Genehmigung der Krone. Blackbeard diente in dieser Zeit an Bord eines jamaikanischen Schiffs unter dem Befehl des Piraten Benjamin Hornigold. Im August 1717 &#252;bernahm er erstmals das Kommando &#252;ber die Sloop Revenge, die zuvor von Stede Bonnet, dem 29-j&#228;hrigen Sohn eines reichen Zuckerrohr-Pflanzers aus Barbados, befehligt worden war. Stede Bonnet hatte diese Sloop bauen und 126 Mann Besatzung anheuern lassen, um ein Leben als Pirat zu f&#252;hren, geriet jedoch bald an ein spanisches Kriegsschiff, dem er nur unter viel Gl&#252;ck entkam, wobei er ein Drittel seiner Besatzung verlor und selber schwer verwundet wurde. In den ersten drei Wochen des Oktobers 1717 griff er die Chesapeake Bay, Philadelphia und New York an, wobei er sich nie l&#228;nger als zwei Tage an einem Ort aufhielt. W&#228;hrend dieser Zeit erbeutete er mindestens 15 Schiffe, womit er schlagartig zum gef&#252;rchtetsten Piraten der Amerikanischen Ostk&#252;ste wurde. Als sich die milit&#228;rischen Beh&#246;rden zur Suche nach ihm aufmachten, war er schon mit seinem Schiff Revenge und zwei aufgebrachten Prisenschiffen unterwegs in die &#246;stliche Karibik. Dort brachte er am 17. November 1717 das 250 Tonnen schwere franz&#246;sische Sklaventransportschiff La Concorde unter Kapit&#228;n Pierre Dosset auf. Dieses war nicht in der Lage sich zu verteidigen, da zuvor 16 Mann der Besatzung an Skorbut und blutigem Ausfluss (durch Skorbut) gestorben und der Rest der Besatzung sehr geschw&#228;cht war. Au&#223;erdem waren von den 40 Stellpl&#228;tzen f&#252;r Kanonen viele unbesetzt, um mehr Platz f&#252;r die 516 angeketteten Sklaven zu machen. Von den 455 zum Zeitpunkt der Aufbringung noch lebenden Sklaven behielt Blackbeard 61, die restlichen 394 &#252;berliess er Kapit&#228;n Pierre Dosset, die dieser anschlie&#223;end auf Martinique verkaufen lie&#223;. Blackbeard &#252;bernahm die La Concorde, baute sie f&#252;r seine Zwecke um und benannte sie in Queen Ann's Revenge. Sklaventransportschiffe waren als Piratenschiffe gut geeignet, da sie gro&#223;, schnell und gut bewaffnet waren. Blackbeard hatte seine Hauptquartiere auf den Bahamas und dem Gebiet der britischen Kolonie Carolina. Der Gouverneur von North Carolina, Charles Eden, nahm Beute von Blackbeard an; im Gegenzug gew&#228;hrte er ihm inoffiziellen Schutz und eine amtliche Begnadigung. Schon nach einigen Wochen kehrte Blackbeard jedoch zur Piraterie zur&#252;ck. Umstritten ist, ob er sein Verm&#246;gen verprasst hatte und seine Finanzlage wieder aufbessern wollte, oder ob ihn, nach vielen Jahren auf See, das Leben an Land schlicht langweilte. Die &#220;berf&#228;lle h&#228;uften sich in der Folgezeit. Den Namen "Blackbeard" erhielt er wegen seines dichten schwarzen Bartes. Blackbeard, der sich mit mehreren Klingen, Messern und Pistolen beh&#228;ngt zeigte, wurde besonders wegen der brennenden Lunten bekannt, die er vor einer Schlacht in seinen langen Bart zu binden pflegte. Diese "teuflische" Erscheinung, die er selbst kultivierte, hat ihn zum Inbegriff des unerschrockenen Freibeuters werden lassen. Dass sein &#196;u&#223;eres auch seinen Ruf als besonders grausamer Seer&#228;uber begr&#252;ndete, hat so manchen Kapit&#228;n eines Handelsschiffs dazu gebracht, ohne Gegenwehr zu kapitulieren. Obwohl Blackbeard durch seine &#228;u&#223;ere Erscheinung und sein Auftreten daf&#252;r sorgte, dass er gef&#252;rchtet wurde, ging es ihm nicht nur um Gewalt. Vor allem kleinere Schiffe kaperte er gerne, ohne auch nur eine Kanone abzufeuern. Diese Gewohnheit wurde ihm letztendlich zum Verh&#228;ngnis.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Jose de San Martin[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1778-1850[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Edward Teach (also Edward Thatch, c.1680-22 November 1718), better known as Blackbeard, was a notorious English pirate who operated around the West Indies and the eastern coast of the American colonies. Although little is known about his early life, he was probably born in Bristol, England. He may have been a sailor on privateer ships during Queen Anne's War before settling on the Bahamian island of New Providence, a base for Captain Benjamin Hornigold, whose crew Teach joined sometime around 1716. Hornigold placed him in command of a sloop he had captured, and the two engaged in numerous acts of piracy. Their numbers were boosted by the addition to their fleet of two more ships, one of which was commanded by Stede Bonnet, but toward the end of 1717 Hornigold retired from piracy, taking two vessels with him. Teach captured a French merchant vessel, renamed her Queen Anne's Revenge, and equipped her with 40 guns. He became a renowned pirate, his cognomen derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance; he was reported to have tied lit fuses under his hat to frighten his enemies. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]He formed an alliance of pirates and blockaded the port of Charleston, South Carolina. After successfully ransoming its inhabitants, he ran Queen Anne's Revenge aground on a sandbar near Beaufort, North Carolina. He parted company with Bonnet and settled in Bath Town, where he accepted a royal pardon. But he was soon back at sea, where he attracted the attention of Alexander Spotswood, the Governor of Virginia. Spotswood arranged for a party of soldiers and sailors to try to capture the pirate, which they did on 22 November 1718. During a ferocious battle, Teach and several of his crew were killed by a small force of sailors led by Lieutenant Robert Maynard. A shrewd and calculating leader, Teach spurned the use of force, relying instead on his fearsome image to elicit the response he desired from those he robbed. Contrary to the modern-day picture of the traditional tyrannical pirate, he commanded his vessels with the permission of their crews and there is no known account of his ever having harmed or murdered those he held captive. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]He was romanticised after his death and became the inspiration for a number of pirate-themed works of fiction across a range of genres. Little is known about Blackbeard's early life. It is commonly believed that at the time of his death he was between 35 and 40 years old and thus born in about 1680.

		<English>[H1]Pedro de Valdivia[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1500-1554[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Pedro de Valdivia was a conquistador, who founded the Chilean cities of Santiago, Concepcion and Valdivia. Valdivia left Europe for the New World in 1535 and by 1537 was helping the Pizarro brothers in their struggle against their rival Diego de Almagro. After participating in the conquest of the provinces of Collao and las Charcas, Valdivia turned his attention to the lands south of Peru. In 1540 he finally mounted his expedition with 150 Spaniards and a 1000 Indians. In 1541 Valdivia founded the settlement of Santiago, only for it to be destroyed later that same year by hostile Indians. Santiago was rebuilt by 1543, and Valdivia continued his incursion southwards meeting fierce resistance and being forced to turn back to Santiago. Between 1549-1553, Valdivia again attempted to conquer the lands to the South meeting hostility from indigenous tribes, though steadily expanding and consolidating Spain's grip over the area with the foundation of further cities including Concepcion, La Imperial, and Valdivia among others. To keep lines of commerce and communication open between his settlements, Valdivia built a series of forts. Suspecting a growing Indian rebellion after the fort of Tucapel was attacked, Valdivia set out to personally inspect the fort. He and his party were ambushed by Indians en route and Valdivia was killed.</English>

Valdivia brach 1535 von Europa in die Neue Welt auf, 1537 unterst&#252;tze er die Gebr&#252;der Pizarro im Kampf gegen deren Rivalen Diego de Almagro. Nach der Beteiligung an der Eroberung der Provinzen Collao und Las Charcas, richtete Valdivia seine Aufmerksamkeit auf die L&#228;nder im S&#252;den von Peru. 1540 zog er schliesslich mit 150 Spaniern und 1000 Eingeborenen los. 1541 gr&#252;ndete er die Siedlung Santiago, welche aber noch im selben Jahr von feindlichen Indianern wieder zerst&#246;rt wurde. Trotzdem wurde Santiago 1543 erneut aufgebaut, Valdivia setzte w&#228;hrenddessen seine Exkursionen in den S&#252;den fort. Hierbei traf er aber auf heftigen Widerstand der dort ans&#228;ssigen St&#228;mme und musste sich nach Santiago zur&#252;ckziehen. 1549-1553 erneuerte Valdivia seine Eroberungsz&#252;ge und es gelang ihm trotz st&#228;ndiger K&#228;mpfe, die Herrschaft Spaniens in der Region durch Gr&#252;ndung zahlreicher Siedlungen und St&#252;tzpunkte (darunter auch Concepcion) zu etablieren. Um die Handels- und Kommunikationswege der Siedlungen zu sch&#252;tzen, liess Valdivia eine Reihe von Forts anlegen. Als ihm ein Angriff auf das Fort Tucapel gemeldet wurde, vermutete Valdivia darin eine gef&#228;hrliche indianische Rebellion und reiste pers&#246;nlich zur Inspektion vor Ort. Auf dem Weg zum Fort gerieten Valdivia und sein Gefolge in einen Hinterhalt, der ganze Trupp wurde von indianischen Kriegern get&#246;tet.</German>

In 1776, Wilson signed the Declaration of Independence, breaking the deadlock of the Pennsylvanian delegation and ensuring Pennsylvania voted for Independence. He continued to be an occasional member of the Continental Congress, and was present at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, proving a strong and important advocate for the creation and implementation of a Federal Constitution.

Hit hard by the Stamp Act, Morris sided with the colonial cause and was elected to the Continental Congress in 1775. He participated in several committees responsible for raising capital and provisions for the Continental Army. Morris often loaned the insolvent Continental government money throughout the war, and personally underwrote the operations of privateers, almost single handedly overseeing the financing of the Revolutionary War. In 1781 he submitted a plan for a national bank, that eventually became the Bank of North America, bringing much needed stability to the American financial system and allowing the United States to establish credit with European nations. After the war, Morris was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and then a Senator for the State of Pennsylvania. Upon completing his term he retired from public life, though never recovered his pre-war fortune. He died in relative poverty in 1806.</English>

		<German>[H1]Robert Morris[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte: [\BOLD]1734-1806[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Geboren in Lancashire, England, verschlug es Robert Morris als Jugendlicher nach Amerika. In Philadelphia ging er zur Schule, zeigte allerdings nur m&#228;ssige Leistungen. Mit 16 Jahren begann Morris eine Lehre beim H&#228;ndler Charles Willing. Nach dem Tode Willings machte dessen Sohn Thomas nunmehr Morris zu seinem Partner. Die Partnerschaft von "Willing, Morris and Company" w&#228;hrte beinahe 40 erfolgreiche Jahre. Vom Stempelgesetz der Briten 1765/66 hart betroffen, entwickelte Morris langsam aber sicher eine Sympathie f&#252;r die Revolution. Im Unabh&#228;ngigkeitskrieg war er in verschiedensten Unternehmen daran beteiligt, Geld f&#252;r die stets klamme Kontinentalarmee zu sammeln. Auch zur See gew&#228;hrte Morris der jungen Nation wichtige Unterst&#252;tzung, indem er seine zahlreichen Schiffe einen erfolgreichen Kaperkrieg gegen die Briten f&#252;hren liess. 1781 war Morris massgeblich an der Konzeption einer Nationalbank beteiligt, woraus dann die "Bank of North America" entstand. Damit war die Grundlage f&#252;r eine stabile nationale Finanzpolitik geschaffen, welche es den USA schliesslich erm&#246;glichte, Kreditgesch&#228;fte mit den europ&#228;ischen Nationen zu f&#252;hren. 1787 wurde Morris als Delegierter in den Verfassungskongress berufen und ausserdem zum Senator von Pennsylvania gew&#228;hlt. Nach seiner Legislatur zog er sich aus dem &#246;ffentlichen Leben zur&#252;ck, konnte aber gesch&#228;ftlich nicht mehr an seine fr&#252;heren Erfolge ankn&#252;pfen - im Gegenteil. Tief verschuldet, verstarb der einstige "Financier der Revolution" 1806.</German>

		<English>[H1]Charles Gravier, Comte de Vergennes[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1717-1787[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes was a French statesman and diplomat. He served as Foreign Minister from 1774 during the reign of Louis XVI, notably during the American War of Independence. Vergennes rose through the ranks of the diplomatic service during postings in Portugal and Germany before receiving the important post of Envoy to the Ottoman Empire in 1755. While there he oversaw complex negotiations that resulted from the Diplomatic Revolution before being recalled in 1768. After assisting a pro-French faction to take power in Sweden, he returned home and was promoted to foreign minister. Vergennes hoped that by giving French aid to the American rebels, he would be able to weaken Britain's dominance of the international stage in the wake of their victory in the Seven Years War. This produced mixed results as in spite of securing American independence France was able to extract little material gain from the war, while the costs of fighting damaged French national finances in the run up to the Revolution. He went on to be a dominant figure in French politics during the 1780s.</English>

		<German>[H1]Charles Gravier, Comte de Vergennes[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte: [\BOLD]1717-1787[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Charles Gravier, Comte de Vergennes, war ein franz&#246;sischer Staatsmann und Diplomat. Als 1774 K&#246;nig Ludwig XVI. den Thron von Frankreich bestieg, wurde Vergennes Aussenminister und bekleidete dieses Amt bis zu seinem Tode 1787. Begonnen hatte Vergennes Diplomatenlaufbahn als Gesandter in Lissabon, 1755 wurde er als Botschafter Frankreichs nach Istanbul berufen. 1772 unterst&#252;tzte er als Gesandter in Stockholm den schwedischen K&#246;nig Gustav III bei dessen Kampf gegen das Parlament. Die Errichtung einer absoluten Monarchie in Schweden wurde als grosser Triumph Frankreichs gewertet, Vergennes erhielt kurz darauf den Posten des Aussenministers. Nach Ausbruch des Unabh&#228;ngigkeitskrieges in Amerika dr&#228;ngte Vergenne darauf, den amerikanischen Rebellen milit&#228;rische Hilfe zukommen zu lassen. Er tat dies nicht etwa aus Sympathie f&#252;r die revolution&#228;re Sache, sondern weil er dadurch den verhassten Gegner England zu schw&#228;chen hoffte. Das Engagement des absolutistischen franz&#246;sischen K&#246;nigsreiches f&#252;r die amerikanische Revolution war daher moralisch sehr heikel, zudem rissen die Kriegsanstrengungen neue L&#246;cher in die Staatskasse. Vergennes blieb Zeit seines Lebens ein einflussreicher Staatsmann und verstarb wenige Jahre vor Ausbruch der franz&#246;sischen Revolution.</German>

Talon bem&#252;hte sich, die Wirtschaft der haupts&#228;chlich Pelzhandel betreibenden Kolonie auf ein breiteres Fundament zu stellen. Hierf&#252;r allerdings war eine gr&#246;ssere Bev&#246;lkerung unabdingbar, weshalb Talon die Einwanderung neuer Siedler - darunter auch rund 1000 Frauen - aus Frankreich arrangierte. Durch die F&#246;rderung von Heiraten und Geburten etablierte Talon ein stabiles Bev&#246;lkerungswachstum und damit die Grundlage f&#252;r die &#246;konomische Diversifizierung der Kolonie. Schon bald florierten in Neufrankreich etliche Gewerbe: Viehzucht, Bergbau, Holzwirtschaft, Schiffsbau und eine bl&#252;hende Landwirtschaft, welche "europ&#228;ische" Pflanzen wie Flachs, Hopfen und Hanf verarbeitete.</German>

Johann August Sutter war ein Schweizer Pionier, auch bekannt als "General Sutter" und "Kaiser von Kalifornien". Sutter war in den 1830er Jahren nach Kalifornien ausgewandert, wo er vom dortigen mexikanischen Gouverneur die Erlaubnis erhielt, im Sacramento-Tal eine Kolonie zu bewirtschaften. Aus dem dabei errichteten Fort Sutter enstand sp&#228;ter schliesslich Sacramento, die heutige Hauptstadt des Bundesstaates. Sutters Privatkolonie "Neu-Helvetien" &#252;berlebte zwar den mexikanisch-amerikanichen Krieg und die Annektion Kaliforniens durch die USA 1848 unbeschadet, wurde aber beim anschliessenden Goldrausch von Gl&#252;ckrittern f&#246;rmlich &#252;berrannt und versank hierbei im Chaos. Sutter, der all seine G&#252;ter verloren hatte, verstarb 1880 v&#246;llig verarmt in Washington.</German>

Nachdem Magellan zu Wasser und zu Lande beinahe 20 Jahre seinem Heimatland Portugal in vielen Expeditionen und K&#228;mpfen gedient hatte, fiel er in Ungnade. Magellan sprach bei der spanischen Krone vor und erhielt 1519 das Kommando &#252;ber f&#252;nf Schiffe, mit welchen er die Weltmeere zu durchqueren und die "Gew&#252;rzinseln" (die heutigen Molukken, Indonesien) zu erreichen trachtete. Magellan war es nicht verg&#246;nnt, pers&#246;nlich den Erfolg seiner Mission zu erleben - er wurde auf den Philippinen von Einheimischen get&#246;tet. 1552 erreichte das letzte &#252;brig gebliebene Schiff seines Geschwaders, die mit 26 Tonnen Gew&#252;rzen beladene "Victoria", schliesslich wieder den spanischen Heimathafen. Kuriosium am Rande: Beim Studium der Schiffstageb&#252;cher schien es, als h&#228;tte die Mannschaft sich im Kalender geirrt und schlichtweg einen Tag zuwenig aufgezeichnet. Dies war somit eine erste Erkenntnis &#252;ber die Notwendigkeit einer Datumsgrenze.</German>

Als de Sousa zum Generalgouverneur Brasiliens ernannt wurde, waren diese Kolonien lange vom Mutterland vernachl&#228;ssigt worden. Die portugiesische Krone hatte praktisch all ihre Kr&#228;fte darauf verwendet, den im Niedergang begriffenen Gew&#252;rzhandel mit Indien zu stabilisieren. Um die Position Portugals in Brasilien zu sichern, scharte de Sousa rund 1000 Kolonisten und Soldaten zusammen - darunter etliche "Degredados", also wegen kleineren kriminellen Vergehen aus Portugal verbannte M&#228;nner. Unter den Einwanderern befanden sich auch sechs Jesuitenm&#246;nche, welche als erste Missionare in Brasilien die Christianisierung - und damit auch die Unterwerfung - der Indianer vorantrieben. Das Verh&#228;ltnis des Gouverneurs de Sousa zu den Eingeborenen scheint trotz der ihm zugeschriebenen Brutalit&#228;t einigermassen gut gewesen zu sein.</German>

He brought 1,000 colonists and soldiers with him on an expedition to Brazil, including four hundred degredados - "men banished from Portugal for some minor criminal activity." Among the colonists were six Jesuits, the first in Brazil, whom he assisted in the christianization of the natives and helped to reaffirm the King's rule over the colonies. In terms of his relations with the Indians, he was able to befriend them and to prevent any further hostilities from them, as he proved to enjoy cruel and often extreme punishment.</Spanish>

Fox begehrte gegen die herrschende kirchliche Lehrmeinung auf und begann, einen eigenen christlichen Glauben zu propagieren. Wegen seinen als ketzerisch aufgefassten Predigten wurde Fox wiederholt der "Gottesl&#228;stererei" angeklagt und verbrachte mehrere Jahre im Gef&#228;ngnis. Trotzdem hielt Fox an seinem Glaubensbekenntnis fest - ungebrochen bereiste er England, Europa und schliesslich auch die Neue Welt, um verschiedene christliche Splittergruppen f&#252;r seine wachsende Qu&#228;ker-Bewegung zu gewinnen. Trotz seiner Sektiererei genoss der idealistische Fox zunehmend den Respekt von Freund und Feind. Die Reinheit seines Strebens und seines Wandels wurde auch von Gegnern wie William Penn oder Oliver Cromwell zugestanden.</German>

A notable public figure in his time, Villegaignon was a mixture of soldier, scientist, explorer, adventurer and entrepreneur. Villegaignon became an important historical figure in the attempt for king Henry II to build a "France Antarctique", by invading present-day Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1555 with a fleet of two ships and 600 soldiers and colonists, mainly French Huguenots and Swiss Calvinists who sought to escape Catholic persecution in Europe. Villegagnon's initial plan was to help the Huguenots establish a colony in the New World. He wanted also to secure a permanent base in Brazil in order to explore brazil wood, then a very valuable source of red dye and hard wood for construction (which gave the name to what was to become Brazil), and to explore precious metals and stones, which the Europeans believed to exist in abundance in the land. After a number of battles against the Portuguese, the French colonists were defeated by Estacio de Sa, a nephew of the third Portuguese Governor-General of Brazil, Mem de Sa, on 15-16 March 1558.</English>

Villegagnon stellte eine f&#252;r diese Epoche typische Mischung aus Soldat, Wissenschaftler, Entdecker, Abenteurer und Unternehmer dar. Er galt als illustre, aber auch umstrittene Figur seiner Zeit. Seine bemerkenswerteste Tat war sicherlich die mit dem Segen des franz&#246;sischen K&#246;nigs Heinrich II. unternommene Gr&#252;ndung von "France Antarctique", einem kolonialen Refugium f&#252;r die in Frankreich verfolgten Hugenotten. Mit 600 gr&#246;sstenteils protestantischen Soldaten und Kolonisten landete Villegagnon 1555 in der Bucht des heutigen Rio de Janeiro, unmittelbar an der s&#252;dlichen Grenze der portugiesischen Kolonie Brasilien. Auf einer vorgelagerten Insel entstand als Zentrum der neuen Kolonie das Fort Coligny. Als Haupterwerbsquelle diente der Verkauf von hochwertigem brasilianischen Hartholz, die Kolonie erhielt zudem weiteren Zustrom an meist calvinistischen Siedlern aus Europa und schien eine bl&#252;hende Zukunft vor sich zu haben. Dies &#228;nderte sich jedoch, nachdem die Franzosen auf der Suche nach wertvollen Metallen ebenfalls auf dem Festland zu siedeln begannen. Nun r&#252;steten die Portugiesen eine Armee aus und berannten die Kolonie. 1558/59 musste Villegagnon sich geschlagen geben und nach Frankreich zur&#252;ckkehren, die Kolonie wurde bis 1567 endg&#252;ltig zerst&#246;rt. Dass sich Villegagnon in sp&#228;teren Jahren vom Hugenotten zum Katholiken wandelte, bildete das letzte bizarre Kapitel im Leben dieses eigenwilligen Mannes.</German>

He tried to help the poor by showing them how to grow olives and grapes, but in Mexico it was discouraged to grow those crops because of Spanish imports of the items. In 1810 he gave the famous speech, "The Cry of Dolores", calling upon the people to protect the interest of their King Fernando VII (held captive by Napoleon) by revolting against the European-born Spaniards who had overthrown the Spanish Viceroy. As he then marched across Mexico, he gathered an army of nearly 90,000 poor farmers and Mexican civilians. They attacked and killed both Peninsular and American born white elites. But Hidalgo's army lacked training and was poorly armed. Eventually, Hidalgo's army ran into a clan of 6,000 well trained and armed Spanish troops. Much of Hidalgo's army fled or was killed.

		<German>[H1]Miguel Hidalgo[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte: [\BOLD]1753-1811[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB] Miguel Hidalgo war ein spanisch-mexikanischer Priester, Gelehrter und Revolution&#228;r. Bereits w&#228;hrend seines Studiums am Kolleg in Valladolid interessierte sich Hialgo f&#252;r revolution&#228;re Schriften. Nachdem er sein Studium der freien K&#252;nste 1770 abgeschlossen hatte, zog Hidalgo nach Mexiko-Stadt und erwarb sich dort die Priesterweihe. Es folgten verschiedene Stationen als Priester und als Professor der Theologie, allerdings &#252;berwarf sich Hidalgo immer wieder mit den ans&#228;ssigen kirchlichen Autorit&#228;ten. 1803 wurde er mit 50 Jahren zum Pfarrer der wohlhabenden Gemeinde Dolores ernannt. Geschockt und besch&#228;mt &#252;ber die ungleiche Verteilung des Reichtums, steckte Hidalgo fortan seine ganze Energie in den gerechten Aufbau der Gemeinde. Er erwirkte den Bau von T&#246;pfereien, Gerbereien sowie Bienen- und Seidenraupenzuchten. Er liess Weinst&#246;cke f&#252;r die Weinerzeugung und Olivenhaine pflanzen, sogar ein Orchester und ein Theater wurden gegr&#252;ndet. Immer wieder musste Hidalgo aber erleben, wie die korrupten spanischen Kolonialherren seine Pl&#228;ne durchkreuzten - vom h&#246;rigen Klerus wurde er zudem anhaltend der Ketzerei beschuldigt. An der Schwelle der Kirche von Dolores rief Hidalgo schliesslich 1810 offen zur Revolution auf und stellte sich an die Spitze eines Volksheeres. Obwohl seine Anh&#228;ngerschaft bald auf viele Tausend Menschen anschwoll, waren es doch zumeist arme, einfache und f&#252;r den Milit&#228;rdienst nicht ausger&#252;stete Bauern. Nach einigen Anfangserfolgen und dem gefeierten Einzug in mehreren St&#228;dten, kam es 1811 zur Begegnung mit regul&#228;ren spanischen Truppen. Obwohl zahlenm&#228;ssig weit &#252;berlegen, hatten die Aufst&#228;ndischen gegen die diszipliniert k&#228;mpfenden Spanier keine Chance - die Rebellion wurde niedergeschlagen und auch Hidalgo fand den Tod. Nach der Unabh&#228;ngigkeit Mexikos von Spanien 1824 wurde der 16. September, der Tag, an dem Hidalgo die Revolution ausgerufen hatte, zum Nationalfeiertag erkl&#228;rt.</German>

Because of a war with England, Brebeuf was forced to return to France but when the peace was signed, he returned to the Hurons in 1634. Brebeuf told many of his experiences in Canada in the Jesuit Relations, an invaluable source of early Canadian history. He was head of the Huron mission, a position he relinquished to Father Jerome Lalemant in 1638. His success as a missionary was very slow and it was only in 1635 that he made his first converts. He claimed to have made 14 as of 1635, and as of 1636 he said the number went up 86.

		<German>[H1]Jean de Br&#233;beuf[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte: [\BOLD]1593-1649[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB] Jean de Br&#233;beuf war ein franz&#246;sischer Jesuit, der im Gebiet der Wyandot (Huronen) am Huronsee in Kanada das Evangelium verk&#252;ndete. 1593 in der Normandie geboren, trat Br&#233;beuf mit 24 Jahren ins Seminar der Jesuiten in Roms ein. Nach seiner Weihe zum Priester reiste er nach Kanada, wo er 1625 in Qu&#233;bec an Land ging. Kurz darauf brach der zum Stamm der Wyandot (Huronen) auf, wo er mit Unterbrechungen - unter anderem durch Kriege Frankreichs gegen England - bis an sein Lebensende verblieb. Er studierte die Sprache und die Sitten der Ureinwohner und galt schon bald als ausgezeichneter Indianer-Experte. Die Missionserfolge entwickelten sich allerdings sehr langsam - und bisweilen auch &#228;usserst brenzlig: Traten ungl&#252;ckliche Ereignisse wie Epidemien, Kriege oder Missernten ein, wurde dies von den Indianern oftmals auf die Pr&#228;senz der Jesuiten zur&#252;ckgef&#252;hrt. Aufzeichnungen zufolge, konnte Br&#233;beuf in den ersten zehn Jahren gerade mal 14 Ureinwohner zur Konvertierung bewegen. Weitere zehn Jahre sp&#228;ter, waren es dann bereits einige Tausend. Br&#233;beuf starb 1649 nach Folterungen am Marterpfahl der Irokesen, nachdem diese bei einem Kampf mit den Wyandot die Missionsstation &#252;berfallen hatten.</German>

		<English>[H1]Walter Raleigh[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1545-1618[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Sir Walter Raleigh was an English aristocrat, writer, poet, soldier, courtier, spy, and explorer. Raleigh was born to a Protestant family in Devon, the son of Walter Raleigh and Catherine Champernowne. Little is known for certain of his early life, though he spent some time in Ireland, in Killua Castle, Clonmellon, County Westmeath, taking part in the suppression of rebellions and participating in the Siege of Smerwick. Later he became a landlord of property confiscated from the native Irish. He rose rapidly in the favour of Queen Elizabeth I, and was knighted in 1585. Instrumental in the English colonisation of North America, Raleigh was granted a royal patent to explore Virginia, which paved the way for future English settlements. In 1591 he secretly married Elizabeth Throckmorton, one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting, without the Queen's permission, for which he and his wife were sent to the Tower of London. After his release, they retired to his estate at Sherborne, Dorset. In 1594 Raleigh heard of a "City of Gold" in South America and sailed to find it, publishing an exaggerated account of his experiences in a book that contributed to the legend of "El Dorado". After Queen Elizabeth died in 1603 Raleigh was again imprisoned in the Tower, this time for allegedly being involved in the Main Plot against King James I, who was not favourably disposed toward him. In 1616 he was released to lead a second expedition in search of El Dorado. This was unsuccessful and men under his command ransacked a Spanish outpost. He returned to England and, to appease the Spanish, was arrested and executed in 1618.</English>

Geboren wurde er in einer einfachen protestantischen Familie in Devon, anonsten ist &#252;ber sein fr&#252;hes Lebens nicht viel bekannt. Nachdem er ab 1569 in diversen Seegefechten an der Seite der Hugenotten sowie als Pirat in westindischen Gew&#228;ssern Erfahrung gewonnen hatte, liess er sich 1680 in Irland nieder. Dort diente er als Befehlshaber einiger Truppen bei der Niederwerfung des Landes unter die Krone Englands. Seine Taten drangen bis zum Hofe, und Raleigh begann in der Gunst von K&#246;nigin Elizabeth I. rapide zu steigen. Ausgestattet mit Handelsprivilegien und als Berater im engsten Kreis der K&#246;nigin wurde er zu einer der einflussreichsten Pers&#246;nlichkeiten Englands. Dabei verfolgte er weiter seine Pl&#228;ne zur Gr&#252;ndung von englischen Kolonien in Nordamerika. Mit Unterst&#252;tzung von verm&#246;genden Investoren finanzierte er mehrere Reisen nach Virginia, um dort seine kolonialen Ziele zu verwirklichen. Ihm selbst verbot die K&#246;nigin jedoch die Teilnahme an den Expeditionen. Erst 1595 f&#252;hrte Raleigh pers&#246;nlich eine Expedition nach S&#252;damerika an, um dort das Goldland El Dorado zu suchen. Die Expedition erforschte den Orinoco, ohne jedoch das sagenhafte El Dorado zu finden. Nach dem Tod Elisabeths I. 1603 fiel er beim neuen K&#246;nig Jakob I. in Ungnade. Wegen des Vorwurfs der Konspiration mit Spanien wurde Raleigh zum Tode verurteilt; sp&#228;ter wurde das Urteil ausgesetzt und Raleigh im Tower of London inhaftiert. Erst dreizehn Jahre sp&#228;ter wurde Raleigh wieder freigelassen. In der Folgezeit unternahm er, wiederum El Dorado vor Augen, eine weitere erfolglose Expedition nach S&#252;damerika. Bei seiner R&#252;ckkehr 1618 wurde er auf Betreiben Spaniens erneut verhaftet und hingerichtet.</German>

		<English>[H1]Benjamin Rush[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1746-1813[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB] Benjamin Rush was a Founding Father of the United States. Rush lived in the state of Pennsylvania and was a physician, writer, educator, humanitarian, as well as the founder of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Rush signed the Declaration of Independence and attended the Continental Congress. He served as Surgeon General in the Continental army, and was blamed for criticising George Washington. Later in life, Rush became a professor of chemistry, medical theory, and clinical practice at the University of Pennsylvania. Despite having a wide influence on the development of American government, he is not as widely known as many of his American contemporaries. Rush was also an early opponent of slavery and capital punishment. Despite his great contributions to early American society, Rush may be more famous today as the man who, in 1812, helped reconcile the friendship of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams by encouraging the two former Presidents to resume writing to each other.</English>

W&#228;hrend des Unabh&#228;ngigkeitskrieges hatte Rush in der Kontinentalarmee als operierender Arzt gedient - er wusste daher bildlich, welche schreckliche Wunden der Krieg den Menschen anzutun vermag.
