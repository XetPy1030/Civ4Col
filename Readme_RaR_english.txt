Welcome to Religion and Revolution !


Religion and Revolution is a huge mod for "Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization" developed by an international team of passionate modders.
It is based on TAC (The Authentic Colonization) 2.03_final but more about that later.

How do I install the mod ?

First make sure that your colonization game is patched to official patch 1.01f.
(Everything else will cause heavy problems.)

Otherwise install it like any other mod.
Unpack the archive from the download link and put the mod into the /mods folder of the game.

Do me a personal favour please:
Do not rename the folder of the mod.
Leave it as it is "Religion_and_Revolution".
This will make it easier for me to analyse savegames.


What is this mod ?

Well, it is currently by far the largest existing CivCol mod.
It is our attempt to unite many of the best ideas and concepts created by the CivCol modding community into one single gigantic mod.
We also tried to recreate some more great features from original Colonization that had been missing to CivCol for some reason.

But we did not simply throw everything together. Almost everything we included was heavily adjusted and improved.
We considered very carefully which features to add and how to implement them.

We want to create a mod that offers more diversity, more possibilites and more challenge.
Step by step we try to improve every single aspect the game offers. (Economy, Exploration, Diplomacy, Trade, Events, Wars, ...)
Some aspects of the mod already have and will continue to move a little bit more towards complex simulation, others a little bit more towards action.

But while doing so, we always try to think about usability, AI, performance, historical authenticity ...

We are not done yet, of course.


This mod is based on TAC ?

Yes, it is originally based on TAC and almost completely includes everything that is in TAC 2.03_final.
With its amazing size, love for the detail and outstanding quality TAC was a great base for this project.

However, we have heavily changed, improved or added to that base.
A very big part of Religion and Revolution is new features not known in TAC.
(In many cases adjusted / improved versions of features from other mods / modcomps but also often created by ourselves.)

We really have to thank all the modders out there for their great work.
Special thanks again to the TAC team.
Without all their hard work, this mod would not exist.


Is it allowed to use your work ?

Yes, generally you can use our source code, graphics, images, ...

!!! However !!!

1. We do contain music that does not belong to us.
René Osmanczyk for example has allowed us to use his music.
If you want to use and publish it as well, you need to ask him before doing so.

2. We do contain a lot of work from other modders and mod projects (especially TAC).
Please consider that, when giving credits as well.
If you are not sure, who to credit, simply ask us and we will try to tell you.


Some Remarks about Distribuiton and Rights of Usage:

Religion and Revolution is a non-commercial mod project.
If you use or distribute Religion and Revolution please pay attention to the copyright.
We allow usage and distribution as long as Religion and Revolution remains non-commercial.
As a matter of course it is permitted to use Religion and Revolution in an own mod project
as long as the copyrights are not harmed, and it is a non-commercial project too.
If you use Religion and Revolution in an own mod project you have to make clear that you have
done changes to the original Religion and Revolution and eventually also to our base project TAC.


Would money help in any way ?

No.
People have offered us to donate money, but we cannot and will not accept money.
This project is for fun only.


What are the plans for the future ?

Well, we are still far away from having reached all our goals.
There are still a lot of big features / wishes on our list. (see Overview)
Otherwise there are also always new ideas coming up.

Is it possible to participate ?

Yes definitely !
Apart from the normal ways community can help and participate (feedback, reporting bugs, sharing ideas, ...),
we are also looking for partners, projects that want to have a cooperation or new team members.
It simply depends on the level of involvment you want to have and how far you share our vision.


Some Advice

We really suggest you read our Overview, FAQ, ingame Colopedia and Tips and Tricks before playing the mod.
If you do not, you are very likely to miss out a lot of changed concepts and cool features ...

Although we have tried to completely translate into German and French,
you probably get the best gaming experience and the most atmospheric texts, when playing in English.

-------------------

We hope you will enjoy playing the mod just as much as we enjoy creating it.
